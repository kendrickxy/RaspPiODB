## Introduction
This project provides a step-by-step guide to using python-OBD with a Raspberry Pi, allowing you to read and interpret data from your vehicle's OBD-II system.

## Features
- **Easy Setup**: Simple instructions to get you up and running quickly.
- **Real-Time Data**: Read and display real-time data from your vehicle.
- **Diagnostics**: Access diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and other important information.
  
## Installation
Follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies and set up the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kendrickxy/RaspPiODB.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd RaspPiODB

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here's how to use the project to read data from your vehicle's OBD-II system:

```bash
# This is a code block in Python
import obd

# Connect to the OBD-II port
connection = obd.OBD()

# Read and display real-time data
response = connection.query(obd.commands.RPM)
print(response.value)
```

## Configuration
